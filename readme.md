Scroll is an ambitious project, designed to replace social media. It's an app that lets you follow and aggregate media feeds sourced from any compatible URL. The app is a downloadable product for iOS & Android (via Capacitor) and for macOS / Windows / Linux desktop (via Tauri).

The feeds must conform to the HTML feeds protocol, which is an emerging technology for self-hosted media distribution. If you're familiar with RSS, HTML feeds are conceptually similar, except the underlying format is a slight subset of HTML and CSS, rather that some bizarre XML format.

Scroll is designed to be an ultra-minimalistic, distraction-free, non-addictive, ad-free, tracker-free media consumption experience.

## Project Status

Scroll is currently pre-alpha. You can follow [Paul Gordon](https://www.twitter.com/heropaulg) on twitter, who is developing this project under the principles of build-in-public.

## Contribution

In order to limit the maintenance overhead of reviewing and validating third-party code, we aren't accepting pull requests from code that isn't small and easily testable (bug fixes). That said, we're always interested in hearing your feature requests, so please submit these as an issue. 


## License (Unlicense)

The team behind Scroll is composed of free speech absolutists who value freedom and self-agency. The source code of this project is therefore licensed under public domain, also known as the "unlicense".
