Scroll is an ambitious project, designed to replace social media. It's an app that lets you follow and aggregate media feeds sourced from any compatible URL. The app is a downloadable product for iOS & Android (built on Capacitor) and for macOS / Windows / Linux desktop (built on Tauri).

The feeds must conform to the HTML feeds protocol, which is an emerging technology for self-hosted media distribution. If you're familiar with RSS, HTML feeds are conceptually similar, except the underlying format is a slight subset of HTML and CSS, rather that some bizarre XML format.

Scroll brings a media consumption experience to the world which is ultra-minimalistic, distraction-free, ad & tracker free, and non-addictive.

## Project Status

Scroll is currently pre-alpha. You can follow [Paul Gordon](https://www.twitter.com/heropaulg) on Twitter, who is developing this project under the principles of build-in-public.

The 1.0 release will be a focused HTML feed reader app without any tools to develop new feeds. In the meantime, feeds will need to be developed separately. Future versions of Scroll will likely address this need.

## Contribution

In order to limit the maintenance overhead of reviewing and validating third-party code, we aren't accepting pull requests from code that isn't small and easily testable (bug fixes). That said, we're always interested in hearing your feature requests, so please submit these as an issue. 


## License (Unlicense)

The team behind Scroll is composed of free speech absolutists who value freedom and self-agency. The source code of this project is therefore licensed under public domain, also known as the "unlicense".
